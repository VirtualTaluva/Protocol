# Game - Community Cards (Hold'em) - Texas Hold'em

Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, or holdem) is a variation of the standard card game of poker. Two cards (hole cards) are dealt face down to each player and then five community cards are placed face-up by the dealer—a series of three ("the flop") then an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street") and another additional card ("the river" or "fifth street"). The best five card poker hand is obtained by taking cards from either the community or their hole cards. Players have the option to check, bet, raise or fold after each deal; i.e., betting may occur prior to the flop, "on the flop", "on the turn", and "on the river".

Texas Hold 'em is the "H" game featured in H.O.R.S.E and in H.O.S.E.
