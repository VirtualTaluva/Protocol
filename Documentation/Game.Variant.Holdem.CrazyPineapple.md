# Game - Community Cards (Hold'em) - Crazy Pineapple

Pineapple hold'em exists halfway between Texas hold'em and Omaha hold'em and has been very popular in Australia and South America, specifically in Medellin, Colombia, where it was first introduced in a private poker room since 2010. Players are initially dealt three cards. Each player then discards one of the three cards (Pre-flop, Post-flop or at Showdown), and the game proceeds exactly as in Texas hold'em.

*Crazy Pineapple:* Players discard their third (unwanted or unneeded) card after the flop, before the fourth community card is dealt.
